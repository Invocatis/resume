Greetings!

I've been looking at positions at Spotify and I'm enthused by what the company might have to offer me. I'd love to chat about how a position might work as an appropriate fit for the next step in my career.

A little about my programmer side:
I'm a programmer, abstract thinker, and theory enthusiast. I'm looking for a new job in a fast moving, inspiring company. I'm looking forward to new ways of programming and expressing my ideas in elegant and efficient ways. I thrive on discovery, and love to approach any problem.

A little about my everyday side:
As my love for coding isn't something I can share with my everyday friends, I try to get out of the sphere of technology when I can. I love to cook for others, play music, and enjoy the company of my friends.

Thanks for the consideration!
Luke
